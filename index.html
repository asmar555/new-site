The Seven Wonders of the World demonstrate humanity's most impressive creations such as the Taj Mahal and the statue
 of Christ the Redeemer. In the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, ancient masterpieces such as the Temple of Artemis and the
Hanging Gardens of Babylon are remembered. However, the Seven Wonders of the Natural World are proof — if needed at all— that
 Mother Nature is just as talented an architect. Compiled by CNN and Seven Natural Wonders in 1997, this list spans all 7 
 continents and includes some of the greatest heights of the earth and depths of the oceans, some lesser-known sites, and
 some well-known features that you may have already visited yourself. While the locations of the world's most breathtaking
wonders are often disputed,
 these seven locations are generally agreed upon as being among the best natural sights anywhere in the world.

<h2>Parícutin</h2>
<div id="example2">
  <p>One of the lesser-known entries on this list, Parícutin is just as impressive as many more well-known landmarks. It
   is an example of a near-perfect cinder cone volcano located in Michoacán, Mexico. One thing sets Parícutin apart from the
   many others of its kind around the world. Modern scientists were able to observe and document every stage of its lifespan –
   from creation to extinction – as it happened. Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, visiting experts and residents of the region w
   ere able to witness the volcano growing from a fissure in a cornfield to a mountainous height of 1,391 ft. After erupting f
   or 19 years, the volcano went quiet in 1952. It is not expected to erupt again.

<h2>The Grand Canyon</h2>
<div id="example1">
<p>Situated in Arizona in the USA, the 277-mile long Grand Canyon is truly awe-inspiring. The canyon, which measures up to a mile deep and some 18 miles wide at its broadest, was formed over time by the unstoppable course of the Colorado River. Scientists estimate that the river first carved out its path more than 17 million years ago. In recent years, increased safety measures have prevented visitors from approaching the edge of the canyon. Still, the Grand Canyon site continues to be a popular tourist destination. A distant glimpse of this powerful and majestic canyon is enough to give memories of a lifetime.</p>

<h2>Northern Lights </h2>
<div id="example3">
  <p>Seen in both the polar regions of the planet, this dazzling light show is aptly referred to as the Northern (or Southern) Lights. Unlike most of the entries on this list, you can view an aurora from many different locations around the world. The higher the latitude, the more likely you are to see them. The Northern Lights effect is brought on by charged cosmic particles entering and interacting with the Earth's atmosphere. It causes vivid colors to be painted across the night sky.

For centuries, humans have speculated endlessly about the cause of this night-time display of colors. References to the lights have been found in texts from Ancient Greece, stories from Norse Mythology, and sources from Medieval England.
