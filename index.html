The Seven Wonders of the World demonstrate humanity's most impressive creations such as the Taj Mahal and the statue
 of Christ the Redeemer. In the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, ancient masterpieces such as the Temple of Artemis and the
Hanging Gardens of Babylon are remembered. However, the Seven Wonders of the Natural World are proof — if needed at all— that
 Mother Nature is just as talented an architect. Compiled by CNN and Seven Natural Wonders in 1997, this list spans all 7 
 continents and includes some of the greatest heights of the earth and depths of the oceans, some lesser-known sites, and
 some well-known features that you may have already visited yourself. While the locations of the world's most breathtaking
wonders are often disputed,
 these seven locations are generally agreed upon as being among the best natural sights anywhere in the world.
